# Jax-Optimization for Convenience Yields and Asset Pricing Models

**Project Instructor**: Professor Zhengyang Jiang  
**Contributor**: Oliver Wang  

This repository contains the code, data, and related research paper for simulations of asset pricing models incorporating convenience yields. The work was conducted as part of a research project led by Professor Zhengyang Jiang.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to simulate asset pricing models that account for the role of convenience yields. The simulations were developed using Python and the Jax library for efficient numerical computations.

### Key Contributions:
- **Simulations**: Implemented asset pricing models with convenience yields using Python and Jax, taking advantage of Jax's ability to automatically differentiate and accelerate computation on CPU/GPU/TPU.
- **MATLAB to Python Translation**: Translated MATLAB code into Python, optimizing the performance using `Optax` for more efficient and accurate loss minimization during the optimization process.
- **Data and Code**: This repository includes all the necessary data files and Python scripts required to reproduce the simulations and results.
